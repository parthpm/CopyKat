This project is a replica of CopyKat game implemented with the help of pixijs. Following are the feature of the game:


* The computer will generate pattern according to level.
* Player has to memorize the pattern & repeat.
* Every time Player correctly replicates the pattern, the score is incremented & the player is advanced to the next level.
* The player will be given 3 lives for maximizing the score & it will remain at the same level if the player fails to replicate.
